        <p> Hello World! My name is <em>Seungjib Kim</em> and I was born and raised in a small industrial city called
            <abbr title="Hangeul: 안산, Korean pronunciation: [an.san]"><strong>Ansan</strong></abbr> in South
            Korea. I've been interested in art in various ways since I was young. I remember drawing a lot, filming
            silly
            short movies of me and my friends and carving soaps and erasers into little animal statues or toy cars.
            Although
            not many people would find my work impressive, I enjoyed doing it and that was enough for me.
        </p>

        <p>
            I consider myself
            an optimistic, spontaneous but calm person who is inspired and often thrilled by creative ideas and
            projects,
            and I'm always enthusiastic about getting involved.
            I am motivated by the sense of accomplishment and pleasure I get when every aspect of my work is perfectly
            pleasing to my clients, colleagues and most importantly, myself, and I use that procedure as fuel for me to
            carry on.
            Staying creative is the most important point in developing my career and will be a pleasant yet challenging
            lifetime task.
        </p>
